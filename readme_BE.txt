As instructed, the app will upload the xml and csv file.
It will list all the data's in the screen.

App behaves dynamically, as it will output any CSV file or XML file to the screen. irrespective of no of rows and columns.

For Reading the CSV , used only file reader concept without using any external plugins or dependencies.

For Reading the XML , used only jquery xml parser plugin.

All the headers and result list will work dynamically without any direct initializing in the html.

On clicking of generate report button, it will generate the errors occurs in the files with two types of error

1. Duplication of reference number.
2. end Balance calculation error.

Now app will find those error and displays the result in the bottom table. 

All the functionlties are written with simple and understandable concepts, which will be easily understood by other developers.

Hopefully this app can directly fit into the production with little modification if needed.
